## 1. Introduction and basic principles of surveying

### Introduction
Surveying is the art of determination of relative positions of points on, above or below the surface of the earthby means of linear and angular measurements (i.e distance,elevation and direction). 
The knowledge of surveying is indespensible to a civil engineer during planning, designing and construction of a project. It is therefore essential for an engineer to have thorough understanding of the techniques best suited for measurement various physical features relating to the project along with the limits of accuracy possible to obtain in the design and construction process.

#### Objectives of surveying
Surveying is generally carried out to fulfill one or more of the following objectives:
- To collect field data
- To prepare map showing relative positions of objects on earth surface
- To draw a map at some suitable scale showing the physical features (buildings, roads, railways, rivers) of a location.
- To analyse and calculate the field parameters necessary for setting out various engineering works
- To calculate areas volumes and other related quantites.
- To setout field parameters at site for further enfineering works.
- To prepare map showing the details of the engineering works to be constructed at a particular location.

  ### Basic Principles of Surveying
  The principles of surveying are given below:
  #### 1. Working from whole to part
  Accordingto the principle of working from whaol to part a surveyor must first establish a large framework of control points with high accuracy and then fill in details with less precise measurements. the overall layout is first surveyed for establishment of control points before focusing in the small details. this helps
  - to prevent the accumulation of errors.
  - to localize the errors within a small area.
  - to establish sufficent number of points of high accuracy throughout the area 
  #### 2. Location of a point by measurement from two control point
  when a new station point is to be set the relative position of suchh point is set by measurements from two already established control point. the measurements thus done can be any one of the following.
  1. by linear measurements from both control points
  2. by angular measurement fro one point and linear measurement from another
  3. by angular measurement from both points
  #### 3. Independent check
  
  #### 4. Consistecy
  #### 5. Economy of accuracy
  #### 6. Safeguarding
  #### 7. Scientific honesty
