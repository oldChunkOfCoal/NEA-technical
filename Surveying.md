## 1. Introduction and basic principles of surveying

### Introduction
Surveying is the art of determination of relative positions of points on, above or below the surface of the earthby means of linear and angular measurements (i.e distance,elevation and direction). 
The knowledge of surveying is indespensible to a civil engineer during planning, designing and construction of a project. It is therefore essential for an engineer to have thorough understanding of the techniques best suited for measurement various physical features relating to the project along with the limits of accuracy possible to obtain in the design and construction process.

#### Objectives of surveying
Surveying is generally carried out to fulfill one or more of the following objectives:
- To collect field data
- To prepare map showing relative positions of objects on earth surface
- To draw a map at some suitable scale showing the physical features (buildings, roads, railways, rivers) of a location.
- To analyse and calculate the field parameters necessary for setting out various engineering works
- To calculate areas volumes and other related quantites.
- To setout field parameters at site for further enfineering works.
- To prepare map showing the details of the engineering works to be constructed at a particular location.

  ### Basic Principles of Surveying
  The principles of surveying are given below:
  #### 1. Working from whole to part
Accordingto the principle of working from whaol to part a surveyor must first establish a large framework of control points with high accuracy and then fill in details with less precise measurements. the overall layout is first surveyed for establishment of control points before focusing in the small details. this helps
  - to prevent the accumulation of errors.
  - to localize the errors within a small area.
  - to establish sufficent number of points of high accuracy throughout the area 
  #### 2. Location of a point by measurement from two control point
when a new station point is to be set the relative position of suchh point is set by measurements from two already established control point. the measurements thus done can be any one of the following.
  1. by linear measurements from both control points
  2. by angular measurement fro one point and linear measurement from another
  3. by angular measurement from both points
  #### 3. Independent check
independent check is the measure of quality assurance. checking the measurements taken in the field from one device by a different indeoendent method or instrument helps in guarding against any gross blunders that may occur during the surveying process. For example in a survey where triangles, rectangles are set out the sides of the triangles or the diagonals of the rectangles should be checked by mathemetical properties like the pythegorean theorem sine and cosine laws.
  #### 4. Consistecy
throughout the surveying process the efforts taken to establish a certain designed precision. these efforts should be consistent for all the control points of similar importance. if one or two control points established with less effort their precision is bound to get impacted which may jeoprodize the entire project
  #### 5. Economy of accuracy
the survey work for a project is carried out for a specific purpose and therefore requires a certain degree of accuracy. the accuracy of the survey should be economicaal which means it should be as accurate as it needs to be and no more than that. the survey for the purpose of detailed design should have higher degreee of accuracy than the survey carried out for preliminary study. a survey is said to be uneconomical when you use more advanced tools than necessary.
  #### 6. Safeguarding
the process of surveying is a very expensive endeavour. a lot f time money and human effort goes into making measurements of an uncharted/ unknown area. these readings and observations taken during the process ehould be properly safeguarded. this means that the observations written down should be kept in a permanent, legible, unambigious and easily understood format. in case of control points established in the field the survey monuments established should be safeguarded and referenced properly.
  #### 7. Scientific honesty
the readings obtained from observations in the field after following the proper instructions should be noted down honestly without altering them.
