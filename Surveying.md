## 1. Introduction and basic principles of surveying

### Introduction
Surveying is the art of determination of relative positions of points on, above or below the surface of the earthby means of linear and angular measurements (i.e distance,elevation and direction). 
The knowledge of surveying is indespensible to a civil engineer during planning, designing and construction of a project. It is therefore essential for an engineer to have thorough understanding of the techniques best suited for measurement various physical features relating to the project along with the limits of accuracy possible to obtain in the design and construction process.

#### Objectives of surveying
Surveying is generally carried out to fulfill one or more of the following objectives:
- To collect field data
- To prepare map showing relative positions of objects on earth surface
- To draw a map at some suitable scale showing the physical features (buildings, roads, railways, rivers) of a location.
- To analyse and calculate the field parameters necessary for setting out various engineering works
- To calculate areas volumes and other related quantites.
- To setout field parameters at site for further enfineering works.
- To prepare map showing the details of the engineering works to be constructed at a particular location.

  ### Basic Principles of Surveying
  The principles of surveying are given below:
  #### 1. Working from whole to part
  this principle 
  #### 2. Location of a point by measurement from two control point
  #### 3. Independent check
  #### 4. Consistecy
  #### 5. Economy of accuracy
  #### 6. Safeguarding
  #### 7. Scientific honesty
